## About TEDx 

The TEDx Program is designed to help communities, organizations and individuals to spark conversation and connection through local TED-like experiences.

At TEDx events, a screening of TED Talks videos — or a combination of live presenters and TED Talks videos — sparks deep conversation and connections at the local level. TEDx events are planned and coordinated independently, under a free license granted by TED.

## About Theme

“Beyond the walls” is like to face obstacles, to overcome failures and to go beyond what we believe it’s impossible to achieve. 
We, young people, are in perpetual prospecting of fields to explore in order to inspire and be inspired. 
Changing the world has always been the motto of young people. We want to show differences, progress, beyond all limits, whatever its origin, to open up unexplored horizons create a locomotive of hope and ambition to incite and encourage young people to pursue their dreams and convince them that there is no limit to change the moment when courage and motivation are present.
